# WeatherShowcase

## Overview
WeatherShowcase is a demo project designed to exhibit my coding style and proficiency in modern iOS development practices. 
This project is built following the Clean Architecture and SOLID principles, ensuring a maintainable, testable and scalable codebase. 

## General Technologies
This project leverages several cutting-edge technologies and architectural patterns, including:
- **SwiftUI**: For building user interfaces with declarative Swift syntax.
- **Combine**: For handling asynchronous events by declaratively processing values over time.
- **async/await**: Utilized for more readable and concise asynchronous code.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Ensuring a robust and testable structure by separating the view model from the view.
- **Native Dependency Injection**: For better manageability and testing of dependencies.
- **Unit Tests**: Demonstrating a commitment to reliability and maintainability of the codebase.

## Installation
Before running the project, you will have to navigate to the scheme settings and add the folowing environment value:
   ```bash
   OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY = <your personal key>
